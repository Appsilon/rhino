# rhino (development version)

1. `test_r()` now clears the environment of loaded box modules before tests are run.
This removes the need for `box::reload()` calls in tests.

# rhino 1.3.0

1. Rhino now works with `shinytest2` out of the box.

# [rhino 1.2.1](https://github.com/Appsilon/rhino/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

1. Fix Rhino GitHub Actions (Cypress used to fail).

# [rhino 1.2.0](https://github.com/Appsilon/rhino/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

1. Don't use symbolic links internally.
This fixes a couple of issues with Node.js tools on Windows:
    * Developer Mode is no longer needed.
    * The `build_js()` and `build_sass()` functions now work with `watch = TRUE`.
    * The `lint_js()` function now works when imports are used in JavaScript.
2. Drop dependency on Yarn - only Node.js is now required.
3. Improved Rhino CI:
    * Run `build_js()` and `build_sass()` CI.
    * Use R version from the lockfile.
    * Upgrade to `r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2`.
4. The `lint_r()` now accepts a `paths` argument which can be used to run it on specific files.
5. The `init()` function will refuse to run in the home directory unless `force = TRUE` is passed.
6. Shiny bookmarking works better with `legacy_entrypoint: source`
(the UI function no longer needs to take an argument).
7. Upgraded to `lintr >= 3.0.0` and updated linter rules.
