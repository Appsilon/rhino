Rhino relies on Node.js to provide tools for working with JavaScript & Sass.
You can read more in [Explanation: Node.js - JavaScript and Sass tools](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/articles/explanation/node-js-javascript-and-sass-tools.html).
To use these tools on Windows 10, you need to:

1. [Install Node.js and yarn](https://go.appsilon.com/rhino-system-dependencies).
1. Enable [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#active-developer-mode).
