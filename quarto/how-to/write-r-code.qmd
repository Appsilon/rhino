The entrypoint to your application is the `app/main.R` file.
It can load packages and other files with `box::use()`.
You should not use `::`, `library()` and `source()` calls in your code.

Each file should have two `box::use()` statements at the top
(one for packages and one for modules).
Avoid `...`. Sort entries alphabetically.

Each file in `app/view` should be a box + Shiny module.
See `app/main.R` for example.
