Why Node.js?
Node.js provides easy access to state of the art tools
for working with JS and Sass: compilers, bundlers, linters.
It might also become an easy way to add any JS library to your Shiny app.

The sass R package uses a deprecated implementation
and we're not sure if there is an R package providing JS bundling.
We prefer to use state of the art tools.
