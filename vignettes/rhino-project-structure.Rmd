# Philosophy
Shiny comes with a powerful
[reactive programming](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/reactivity-overview.html) model
and a rich set of functions for creating UI widgets
or custom [HTML structure](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tag-glossary.html).
These features make it possible to quickly build impressive, interactive applications,
but they can also make your code harder to test and reuse.

To address this, we recommend to separate the code which must depend on Shiny
from the logic which can be expressed without it.
The division makes for more robust and maintainable apps in our experience.
To support this separation,
Rhino encourages a specific structure for the R sources of your application:

* `main.R`: The entry point to your application.
* `logic`: Application code independent from Shiny.
* `view`: Shiny modules and related code.

## Logic
Code which uses reactivity or UI builder functions can be hard to test and reuse.
With proper design it is possible to express most of your application logic
using plain R functions and data structures (like lists, data frames).

Use the `logic` directory for code which can be expressed without Shiny.

## View
The `view` directory should contain code which describes the user interface of your application.
Use the functions defined in `logic` here and connect them using reactivity.

Structure your application using [Shiny modules](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html).
A typical module can look something like this:
```r
box::use(
  shiny[moduleServer, NS, renderText, tagList, textInput, textOutput],
)
box::use(
  app/logic/messages[hello_message],
)

#' @export
ui <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  tagList(
    textInput(ns("name"), "Name"),
    textOutput(ns("message"))
  )
}

#' @export
server <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    output$message <- renderText(hello_message(input$name))
  })
}
```

# Box modules
With large applications it is critical for maintainability
to properly structure your code using files and directories.
R comes with the `library()` and `source()` functions,
but its functionality is limited when it comes
to dividing your code into modules and expressing their dependencies.

To address this, Rhino uses the [box](https://klmr.me/box/) R package,
which allows you to modularize your code in a similar way to languages like Python and Java:
```r
box::use(
  dplyr, # Import dplyr. Its functions can be used via `$`, e.g. `dplyr$filter`.
  shiny[reactive], # Import the `reactive()` function from shiny package.
)
box::use(
  logic/data_validation # Import the `logic/data_validation.R` module.
)
```

The best place to learn about box is its official [documentation](https://klmr.me/box/).
Some useful box features are also explained in the sections below.

## `__init__.R` files
Objects exported by an `__init__.R` file can be imported from its parent directory.

### Example
Assume we have an `app/foo/__init__.R` file with the following content:
```r
#' @export
bar <- "Hello!"
```

We can now import `bar` as if it was defined in `app/foo.R`:
```r
box::use(
  app/foo[bar]
)
```

This mechanism can be used in combination with reexports
to make it easier to import multiple modules from a single directory.

## Reexports
A module can reexport objects imported from a different module
by applying `#' @export` to a `box::use()` statement.

### Example
Assume we have modules `analysis_tab.R` and `download_tab.R` in the `app/view` directory.
We can reexport them from `app/view/__init__.R` like this:
```r
#' @export
box::use(
  app/view/analysis_tab,
  app/view/download_tab
)
```

The following `box::use()` statements are now equivalent:
```r
box::use(
  app/view/analysis_tab,
  app/view/download_tab,
)
box::use(
  app/view[analysis_tab, download_tab],
)
```
