# Rationale
With large applications it is critical for maintainability
to properly structure your code using files and directories.
R comes with the `library()` and `source()` functions,
but its functionality is limited when it comes
to dividing your code into modules and expressing their dependencies.

To address this, Rhino uses the [box](https://klmr.me/box/) R package,
which allows you to modularize your code in a similar way to languages like Python and Java:
```r
box::use(
  dplyr, # Import dplyr. Its functions can be used via `$`, e.g. `dplyr$filter`.
  shiny[reactive], # Import the `reactive()` function from shiny package.
)
box::use(
  logic/data_validation, # Import the `logic/data_validation.R` module.
)
```

Box modules force you to be explicit about the dependencies between your files and packages.
The graph of dependencies is visible at a glance in an app developed with box,
while the traditional approach (`global.R`, `library()`, `source()`)
makes it easy to build an app which only the author understands.
Introduction of box to existing apps written without it
has helped to improve the code structure and find bugs.

# Usage
The best place to learn about box is its official [documentation](https://klmr.me/box/). 
The discussion here will mainly focus on how to use box inside Rhino.

Rhino suggests the use of [`app/logic` and `app/view`](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/articles/explanation/application-structure.html).
Rhino creates these directories as a default Rhino app structure. 
Code that is independent of Shiny should be kept in `app/logic` 
while code using or related to Shiny modules should be kept in `app/view`. 
This app structure works well with box as it treats files and folders of R code as independent.
It makes code modular and reusable without the need of writing a package.
Code is also better organized and encourages nesting with this structure.

Importing reusable code from existing R packages or from the modules inside Rhino
requires `box::use()`. 
`library()` and `require()` [does not work](https://klmr.me/box/articles/faq.html#can-i-call-library-require-source-inside-a-module) inside a box module.
`box::use()` imports code locally, unlike `library()`, `require()`, `source()`, or `global.R`
that attaches names globally. 

# Other Features
Some useful box features are also explained in the sections below.

## Init files
Objects exported by an `__init__.R` file can be imported from its parent directory.

### Example
Assume we have an `app/foo/__init__.R` file with the following content:
```r
#' @export
bar <- "Hello!"
```

We can now import `bar` as if it was defined in `app/foo.R`:
```r
box::use(
  app/foo[bar]
)
```

This mechanism can be used in combination with reexports
to make it easier to import multiple modules from a single directory.

## Reexports
A module can reexport objects imported from a different module
by applying `#' @export` to a `box::use()` statement.

### Example
Assume we have modules `analysis_tab.R` and `download_tab.R` in the `app/view` directory.
We can reexport them from `app/view/__init__.R` like this:
```r
#' @export
box::use(
  app/view/analysis_tab,
  app/view/download_tab
)
```

The following `box::use()` statements are now equivalent:
```r
box::use(
  app/view/analysis_tab,
  app/view/download_tab,
)
box::use(
  app/view[analysis_tab, download_tab],
)
```

# Known issues

### Lazy-loaded data
Box 1.1.0 doesn't support lazy-loaded [data](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#data-data),
so e.g. `box::use(datasets[mtcars])` won't work.
This feature should be available in the next release
(see this [issue](https://github.com/klmr/box/issues/219)).
For now please use `datasets::mtcars` in your code.

### Trailing commas
Box 1.1.0 allows trailing commas in `box::use()` statements and code,
but they can cause problems in some circumstances:

1. Reexports ([issue](https://github.com/klmr/box/issues/263)).
2. Functions accessed via `$` ([issue](https://github.com/klmr/box/issues/266)).

Both issues should be fixed in the nearest release.
