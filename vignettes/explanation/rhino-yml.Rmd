# :wrench: Configure Rhino with `rhino.yml`
Rhino uses its own `rhino.yml` config file where you can set a few options on how it works in your app. Currently available
options are described below.

## `rhino.yml` options
```yaml
sass: string               # required | one of: "node", "r"
legacy_entrypoint: string  # optional | one of: "app_dir", "source", "box_top_level"
```

### `sass`
Configures whether [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) should be build using [R
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sass) or [Node
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass). The latter provides newest implementation, at a cost
of additional system dependencies for development (`node` and `yarn`).

### `legacy_entrypoint`
This setting is useful when migrating an existing Shiny application to Rhino. For more details see
[`rhino::app()` details section](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/reference/app.html#details-1).
