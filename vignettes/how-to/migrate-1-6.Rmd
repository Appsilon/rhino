Transition your project to Rhino version 1.6 with this comprehensive guide. The latest version includes Node module updates to enhance your development workflow.

# Prerequisites

- Back up your project data.
- Ensure Node.js is up-to-date on your machine.

# Installation of Rhino 1.6

Choose one of the following methods to install Rhino 1.6:

## Option 1: Using `renv`

Install Rhino using renv and then take a snapshot of your project dependencies:

```r
renv::install("rhino")
renv::snapshot()
```

## Option 2: Using `rhino::pkg_install` (for Rhino v1.4+)

For newer versions of Rhino, you can use the built-in package installation function:

```r
rhino::pkg_install("rhino")
```

After the installation, restart your R session to ensure all changes take effect.

# Migration Steps

## Step 1: Remove the `.rhino` Directory

Locate and remove the `.rhino` directory from the root of your project. This directory contains configuration settings from the previous version of Rhino.

```bash
rm -rf .rhino
```

## Step 2: Run Node Tool Functions

Invoke one of the following commands to run Node tools. This action will regenerate the `.rhino` directory with a new configuration, including updated Node modules.

```r
rhino::build_sass()
rhino::lint_sass()
rhino::build_js()
rhino::lint_js()
```

## Step 3: Migrate Cypress End-to-End Tests

If your project includes Cypress end-to-end tests, initiate the migration wizard with:

```r
rhino::test_e2e(interactive = TRUE)
```

Follow the prompts in the migration wizard to update your end-to-end tests.

## Step 4: Test Your Project

Conduct extensive testing to confirm that all components of your project function properly after the migration.

# Final Steps

If you encounter any issues or have further questions after migrating to Rhino 1.6, please consult the GitHub discussions for Rhino for community and developer support.
