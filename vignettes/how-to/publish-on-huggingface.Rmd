[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a platform that allows publishing models, datasets, and web applications.
Shiny applications (including Rhino) also can be hosted this way, with Hugging Face support for Docker containers as SDK.
A sample Rhino application can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Appsilon/shiny-for-r-rhino).

To publish your application, you will need to provide a `Dockerfile` that defines the container that will be used to host it.
Such a `Dockerfile` can look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM rocker/shiny-verse:4.3.0

# Workaround for renv cache
RUN mkdir /.cache
RUN chmod 777 /.cache

WORKDIR /code

# Install renv
RUN install2.r --error \
    renv

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN Rscript -e 'options(renv.config.cache.enabled = FALSE); renv::restore(prompt = FALSE)'

CMD ["R", "--quiet", "-e", "shiny::runApp(host='0.0.0.0', port=7860)"]
```

You might need to modify it with e.g. different R version, base Docker image, or some additional dependencies.
Check [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
and [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker)
for more details.
