In some cases you might want to put your Rhino application in a subdirectory of your repository -
for example, to keep multiple apps in a single repository.
Most of Rhino features will work just fine, but CI will need some adjustment.

Rhino comes with a CI workflow (Continuous Integration)
for [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
which automatically runs linters and tests whenever you push to the repository.
It will work out of box if you application lives in the root of your git repository.
You will need some manual tweaks if your application lives in a subdirectory:

1. Place all workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Adjust each workflow by setting
a [default working directory](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iddefaultsrun)
accordingly.
