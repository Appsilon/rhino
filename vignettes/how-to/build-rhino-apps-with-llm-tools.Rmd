LLM tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) can be extremely helpful when building apps with Rhino.
However, the unique project structure and the use of the box package for module imports can make it harder for these tools to understand and assist effectively.
The good news is that their performance can be significantly improved by providing custom instructions.

# Custom instructions for GitHub Copilot

To optimize GitHub Copilot for working with Rhino projects,
you can create a file named `copilot-instructions.md` in the `.github/` directory of your repository.
To see instructions below as markdown [visit vignette source](https://github.com/Appsilon/rhino/blob/main/vignettes/how-to/build-rhino-apps-with-llm-tools.Rmd).

Example instuctions:

## Importing and exporting

Use only `box::use` for imports. Using `library` and `::` is forbidden.

`box::use` statement (if needed) should be located at the top of the file.

There can be two `box::use` statements per file. First one should include only R packages, second should only import other scripts.

Imports in `box::use` should be sorted alphabetically.

Using `[...]` is forbidden.

All external functions in a script should be imported. This includes operators, like `%>%`.

A script should only import functions that it uses.

### Ways of importing

There are two ways a package or a script can be imported:

1. List imported functions - functions imported are listed in []

```r
box::use(
  dplyr[filter],
)

filter(mtcars, cyl > 4)
```

Use it if there are no more than 8 functions imported from this package/script.

2. Import package and access functions with `$`

```r
box::use(
  dplyr,
)
dplyr$filter(mtcars, cyl > 4)
```

When moving function into a different script, remember to adjust imports in `box::use`:

1. Add import for all required functions to the file where you moved the function.
2. Make sure to follow the correct way of importing (direct or using $) in the new file. Modify it if needed.
3. Remove redundant imports from the original file.
4. Import the moved function in the original file.

Use it if there are more than 8 functions imported from this package/script.

### Exporting

If a function is used only inside a script, it should not be exported.

If a function is used by other scripts, it should be exported by adding `#' @export` before the function.

## Rhino modules

When creating a new module in `app/view`, use the template:
```r
box::use(
  shiny[moduleServer, NS]
)

#' @export
ui <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)

}

#' @export
server <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {

  })
}
```

## Unit tests

All R unit tests are located in `tests/testthat`.

There should be only one test file per script, named `test-{script name}.R`.

If testing private functions (ones that are not exported), use this pattern:

```r
box::use(app/logic/mymod)

impl <- attr(mymod, "namespace")

test_that('{test description}', {
    expect_true(impl$this_works())
})
```

### Testing exported and non-exported functions

When testing a box module that contains both exported and non-exported functions:

1. Import the entire module without specifying individual functions:

```r
box::use(
  app/logic/mymodule,
)
```

2. Access exported functions using the module name with `$`:

```r
test_that("exported function works", {
  expect_equal(mymodule$exported_function(1), 2)
})
```

3. For testing non-exported functions, get the module's namespace at the start of the test file:

```r
impl <- attr(mymodule, "namespace")

test_that("non-exported function works", {
  expect_equal(impl$internal_function(1), 2)
})
```

This pattern allows testing both public and private functions while maintaining proper encapsulation.
