To further streamline your development process, a collection of Add-ins has been designed to integrate with RStudio. These Add-ins provide convenient shortcuts and tools for common tasks.

These Add-ins enhance the RStudio development workflow by providing quick access to essential tasks and enabling background execution, allowing for better transitions between coding and task management.

This guide introduces each Rhino Add-in
