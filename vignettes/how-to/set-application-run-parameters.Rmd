When running a Shiny application you might want to set parameters like port or host.
In Rhino, this can be done the same as in a regular Shiny application
 - by passing arguments to [`shiny::runApp`](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/1.7.4/runapp).

For example, if you want to run your application with the host set to `0.0.0.0`
(so you can serve it in your local network) and port set to `5000`, you can run:

```r
# R console

shiny::runApp(host = "0.0.0.0", port = 5000)
```

If you want to make your settings permanent, you can modify your `.Rprofile`
file and set [Shiny options](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/1.7.4/shinyoptions) there:

```r
# .Rprofile

if (file.exists("renv")) {
  source("renv/activate.R")
} else {
  # The `renv` directory is automatically skipped when deploying with rsconnect.
  message("No 'renv' directory found; renv won't be activated.")
}

# Allow absolute module imports (relative to the app root).
options(box.path = getwd())

# Shiny options
options(shiny.host = "0.0.0.0")
options(shiny.port = 5000)
```

Make sure you don't remove entries related to `renv` and `box` as
they are required for your Rhino application to work!
