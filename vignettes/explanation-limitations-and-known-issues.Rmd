A Rhino app must live in git root for GitHub Actions CI to work.

The box package is still in development
and the latest CRAN version doesn't yet support lazy-loaded data.
This feature should be available in the nearest release
(see this [issue](https://github.com/klmr/box/issues/219)),
so you'll be able to write e.g. `box::use(datasets[mtcars])`.
For now please use `datasets::mtcars` in your code.
