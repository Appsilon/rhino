# Why Rhino?
Rhino allows you to create Shiny apps "The Appsilon Way"  - like a fullstack software engineer: apply best software engineering practices, modularize your code, test it well, make UI beautiful and think about adoption from the very beginning. It is an opinionated framework with a focus on software engineering practices and development tools.

Rhino supports your work in 3 main areas:

1. Clear code (scalable app architecture, modularization based on Box and Shiny modules.
2. Quality (unit tests, E2E tests with Cypress, logging and monitoring, linting).
3. Automation (project startup, CI with Github Actions, dependency management with renv, configuration management with config, Sass and Javascript bundling with ES6 support via Nodejs).

These features are often implemented using well-known packages. The biggest value in Rhino is that you instantly get all of them working together and pre-configured.
