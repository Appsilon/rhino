# Why Rhino?
Rhino allows you to create Shiny apps "The Appsilon Way"  - like a fullstack software engineer: apply best software engineering practices, modularize your code, test it well, make UI beautiful and think about adoption from the very beginning. It is an opinionated framework with a focus on software engineering practices and development tools.

Rhino supports your work in 3 main areas:

1. Clear code (scalable app architecture, modularization based on Box and Shiny modules.
2. Quality (unit tests, E2E tests with Cypress, logging and monitoring, linting).
3. Automation (project startup, CI with Github Actions, dependency management with renv, configuration management with config, Sass and Javascript bundling with ES6 support via Nodejs).

These features are often implemented using well-known packages. The biggest value in Rhino is that you instantly get all of them working together and pre-configured.

## Get it
Stable version:
```r
install.packages("rhino")
```

Development version:
```r
remotes::install_github("Appsilon/rhino")
```

## Usage

### üèóÔ∏è Create a Shiny Application from Scratch
Running `rhino::init()` will create a following application structure for you. Once that is done
simply run `shiny::runApp()` to start a minimal Rhino application! :rocket:

With the structure prepared you can [configure Rhino](#wrench-configure-rhino-with-rhinoyml) or jump
straight into [development using Rhino](#construction-develop-a-shiny-application-with-rhino)!

---

### :recycle: Migrate an Existing Shiny Application to Rhino
To migrate an application to Rhino create an application from scratch as described above. Then refer
to [`rhino::init()` details section](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/reference/init.html#details-1)
for a recommended approach of proceeding with the migration.

---

### :wrench: Configure Rhino with `rhino.yml`
Rhino uses its own `rhino.yml` config file for preserving your preferences. Currently available
options are described in the taxonomy below.

#### `rhino.yml` Taxonomy
```yaml
sass: string               # required | one of: "node", "r"
legacy_entrypoint: string  # optional | one of: "app_dir", "source", "box_top_level"
```

##### `sass`
Configures whether [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) should be build using [R
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sass) or [Node
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass). The latter provides newest implementation, at a cost
of additional system dependencies for development (`node` and `yarn`).

##### `legacy_entrypoint`
This setting is useful when migrating an existing Shiny application to Rhino. For more details see
[`rhino::app()` details section](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/reference/app.html#details-1).
